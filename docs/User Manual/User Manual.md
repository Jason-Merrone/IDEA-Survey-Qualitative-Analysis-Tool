## Introduction
Welcome to the IDEA Ideas web application! This user guide will help you get started with using IDEA Ideas to help quickly process student feedback for your course!

## Getting Started

### Installation
If you are hosting this web application yourself, please consult the **[Installation Guide](Installation%20Guide.md)** on how to set up and run the application.

### Signing Up and Signing In
If you are self-hosting on your local machine, this web application can be accessed by going to **[`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)**.

If you are not currently logged into IDEA Ideas, you will be automatically redirected to the login page ([`http://localhost:3000/login`](http://localhost:3000/login)). The login page will have several options, as can be seen in the screenshot below.

#### If you have a Utah State University (USU) account:
1. Click on the **Sign-in with SSO** button. You will be redirected to the USU sign-on portal.
    - If your web browser sends you to a page that says "Your connection isn't private" or gives a "Certificate Authority Invalid" error, please click on the **Advanced** button and the *Continue to localhost (unsafe)* link. This will allow you to access the USU SSO. 
2. Enter your USU credentials (A-Number and USU password) and complete the multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge.
3. After entering your USU credentials and completing the MFA challenge, you will be signed-in and redirected to the IDEA Ideas website.

#### If you have an IDEA Ideas account:
1. Enter your A-Number (ex. `A01234567`) and click the **Login** button.

#### If you do *not* have an IDEA Ideas account or USU account:
1. Click on the **Create Account** button.
2. Fill out the `Account Number`, `Full Name`, `Preferred Name`, `Email`, and `Role` fields.
3. Click on the **Create Account** button to submit the form. 
    - If any information is invalid or if the account already exists, you will be presented with an error message asking you to sign-in with the account instead of trying to create it.
4. Upon the account being successfully created, you will be automatically logged-in and redirected to your `Dashboard` page.

## Website Navigation
### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is present on each page of the IDEA Ideas website. The navigation bar has links to your `Dashboard` and `AI Chat` pages. Clicking on the links will redirect you to it's respective page.
### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
The `Dashboard` page is your personal home page for the IDEA Ideas website, and the page can be accessed by clicking on the `Dashboard` link in the navigation bar. From the `Dashboard` page, you can upload PDFs of IDEA course evaluations and see links to previously generated IDEA course survey reports.
### AI Chat (`/chat`)
The `AI Chat` page is the main page from which you can consult with your own personal AI chatbot about a specific course evaluation PDF. When you go to the `AI Chat` page (by clicking on the link in the navigation bar), you will see all (if any) previous chats that you have had.

To select an existing chat, click on the chat name. To delete an existing chat, click on the **Delete** button next to the chat name.

To create a new chat, click on the **Create New Chat** button. You will be presented with a popup box that will ask you to select or upload a PDF to use for the new chat. After selecting the correct PDF, click on the **Confirm** button.

After you have selected or created your chat, you can ask the AI chatbot questions about the selected course evaluation PDF by entering your message into the box that says *Type your message*. After typing out your message, click on the **Send** button and wait for the AI's response!
