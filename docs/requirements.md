# Introduction

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide faculty at Utah State University (USU) with enhanced insights from their IDEA survey reports. IDEA surveys are conducted at the end of each semester, where students rate and comment on their courses and instructors. This project leverages artificial intelligence to summarize student comments over a selected timeframe and set of classes, delivering three key insights to professors:

1. An overview of the general comments.
2. Highlights of what was done well during the semester.
3. Recommendations for improvement.

The system will integrate seamlessly with existing USU systems, allowing professors to log in and generate AI-driven analyses of their IDEA survey reports. Additionally, professors will have the option to ask specific questions to the AI, such as "What do students think about the fairness of my quizzes?" or "How difficult is my class?" to gain deeper insights into student perceptions.

## Stakeholders

### Impacted Groups

1. **USU Office of Data & Analytics**: Sponsoring the tool’s development and responsible for business operations post-launch. Design decisions directly impact this office.
2. **USU Faculty**: Professors, instructors, and department heads will form the primary user base. Their workflow will be directly influenced by this tool.
3. **University Administration**: Reports generated by the tool will likely be reviewed by administrative offices. The tool will also help increase compliance with course evaluation policies.
4. **USU Student Body**: Though not direct users, students' feedback data will be processed by this system, indirectly impacting decisions that affect student life.

## Purpose of Requirements Document

This document outlines the specifications and expectations for developing the AI-driven analysis system for IDEA survey reports at USU. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, faculty members, and Erik Falor to ensure clear understanding of project objectives, functionalities, and constraints. By detailing functional, non-functional, technical, and user requirements, this document aims to provide a solid foundation for the successful implementation of the system.
