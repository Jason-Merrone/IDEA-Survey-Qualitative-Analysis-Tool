"This professor micromanages EVERYTHING! Every tiny detail has to be done *exactly* their way, or they'll tear it apart.  It feels impossible to express original ideas because they constantly shut down anything that deviates from their narrow viewpoint. Be prepared for constant criticism and a feeling that nothing you do is ever good enough.  Avoid this class if you value your creativity and intellectual freedom.

They used tons of real-world examples and even brought in guest speakers who made everything so much more interesting. You could tell they really cared about making sure we understood the material.  Highly recommend this class!
