### Task 1
----
**Set up Next.js project**
- **Description:** Configure the initial Next.js project structure, install necessary dependencies (e.g., TypeScript, ESLint), and set up a basic starting point for development.
- **Outcome:** A functioning Next.js project that can be built upon for other tasks.

### Task 2
----
**Implement basic routing/API Routes**
- **Description:** Create the foundational routing structure in Next.js, including setting up API routes for key functions (e.g., data fetching, user actions).
- **Outcome:** The project will have a navigable structure, with API routes in place for further development.

### Task 3
----
**Design initial UI layout**
- **Description:** Create the basic user interface layout, adhering to USU branding standards. Design main components such as navigation, dashboard, and key pages.
- **Outcome:** A visually appealing layout that serves as a template for adding detailed content and functionality.

### Task 4
----
**Set up database with Prisma**
- **Description:** Configure Prisma for database interactions. Define the schema, set up migrations, and ensure a connection to the database.
- **Outcome:** A functioning database with an initial schema set up for storing relevant data.

### Task 6
----
**Implement SSO authentication**
- **Description:** Set up Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication using USU's SSO system, allowing users to log in securely. Ensure authentication is integrated with Next.js.
- **Outcome:** Users can securely log in to the application using their USU credentials.

### Task 7
----
**AI Data Set Functioning**
- **Description:** Ensure the dataset used for AI model training or analysis is properly formatted and prepared. Perform necessary preprocessing steps to make the data compatible.
- **Outcome:** A well-prepared dataset ready for use in training and evaluating the AI model.

### Task 8
----
**Small model**
- **Description:** Develop a simplified AI model for testing and initial results. Focus on creating a lightweight model for quick iterations and early feedback.
- **Outcome:** A basic AI model capable of performing limited tasks, serving as a foundation for further development.

### Task 9
----
**PDF-Parsing**
- **Description:** Implement functionality to extract text from PDF documents for further processing, such as summarization or semantic analysis.
- **Outcome:** PDF files can be parsed, and text content can be extracted and used in the application.
