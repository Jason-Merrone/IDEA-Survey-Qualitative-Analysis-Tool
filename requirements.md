# Introduction

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide faculty at Utah State University (USU) with enhanced insights from their IDEA survey reports. IDEA surveys are conducted at the end of each semester, where students rate and comment on their courses and instructors. This project leverages artificial intelligence to summarize student comments over a selected timeframe and set of classes, delivering three key insights to professors:

1. An overview of the general comments.
2. Highlights of what was done well during the semester.
3. Recommendations for improvement.

The system will integrate seamlessly with existing USU systems, allowing professors to log in and generate AI-driven analyses of their IDEA survey reports. Additionally, professors will have the option to ask specific questions to the AI, such as "What do students think about the fairness of my quizzes?" or "How difficult is my class?" to gain deeper insights into student perceptions.

## Purpose of Requirements Document

The purpose of this requirements document is to clearly outline the specifications and expectations for the development of the AI-driven analysis system for IDEA survey reports at Utah State University (USU). This document serves as a comprehensive guide for all developers, faculty members, and Erik Falor ensuring that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the project's objectives, functionalities, and constraints. By detailing the functional, non-functional, technical, and user requirements, this document aims to facilitate effective communication, minimize ambiguities, and provide a solid foundation for the successful implementation and deployment of the system.

# MoSCoW Prioritization of Requirements

## Must-Have
- The essential features and functionalities that are critical for the system's operation.
- These requirements must be implemented and delivered in the final product.
- Failure to include these elements would result in a system that does not meet its primary objectives or user needs.

## Should-Have
- Important features that are not critical for the system's core functionality.
- These requirements are considered important but can be deferred to a later phase if necessary.
- Including these elements would enhance the system's usability, performance, or user experience.

## Could-Have
- Desirable features that are not essential for the system's operation.
- These requirements are considered optional and can be included if time and resources permit.
- Implementing these elements would provide additional value or functionality to the system but are not necessary for its basic operation.

## Won't-Have
- Features that are explicitly excluded from the current scope of the project.
- These requirements are considered out of scope and will not be implemented in the current iteration.
- Excluding these elements does not impact the system's core functionality or user experience.

# Requirement Descriptions

## Functional Requirements
- Description of the core functionalities that the system must perform.
- User interactions and system responses.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance criteria such as speed, scalability, and reliability.
- Security requirements and data protection measures.

## Technical Requirements
- Hardware and software specifications.
- Integration with other systems and technologies.

## User Requirements
- User roles and permissions.
- Usability and accessibility considerations.

# Use Cases

- [ ] Create use case diagrams to visually represent the interactions between users and the system.
  - If anyone is familiar with Mermaid, we can include the diagrams directly inside the Markdown.
- [ ] Define and document each use case with a brief description.
- [ ] Outline the main flow and alternative flows for each use case.

# User Stories

- Simple Format: Write user stories in a simple, standardized format.
  - Template: "As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]."
  - Example: "As a power-user, I want to quickly navigate the file system so that I can find the files I want to open."
  - Example: "As a guild captain, I want to choose a righteous quest so that my guild members will be happy with my leadership and not vote me out."
- Define "done": The story describes a complete interaction with the system from start to finish.
- Stick to One Actor: If the user story involves multiple users, consider splitting it into separate stories.
- Review and Update: Continuously review and update user stories as more is learned about the system or the users' needs.
- Keep stories up-to-date to reflect any changes in requirements.
