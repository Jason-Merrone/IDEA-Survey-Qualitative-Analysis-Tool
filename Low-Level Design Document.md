## 5. Security
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Describe the mechanisms used to authenticate users and control access to system features.
- **Data Encryption**: Specify how sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential security threats and describe the strategies to mitigate them.
- **Audit Logs**: Explain how security-related events (e.g., logins, data access) are logged and monitored.

---

## 6. Performance
- **Caching**: Describe any caching mechanisms used to improve performance.
- **Load Balancing**: If applicable, detail how load balancing is used to distribute traffic across servers.
- **Optimizations**: List performance optimizations such as database indexing, efficient algorithms, or batch processing.

---

## 7. Maintainability
- **Code Modularity**: Explain how the system is broken down into modules that are easy to understand, modify, and test.
- **Error Handling**: Describe the error-handling mechanisms in place, including logging and exception management.
- **Documentation**: Mention the level of documentation available (code comments, developer guides, API documentation, etc.).
- **Testability**: Outline the unit and integration testing strategies, including automated testing.

---

## 8. Integration
- **External Systems**: List the external systems or services (e.g., APIs, databases) that this system integrates with.
- **Data Flow**: Provide diagrams and explanations for how data flows between this system and external systems.
- **Interface Specifications**: Define any interfaces (RESTful APIs, messaging queues, etc.) used for communication with external systems.

---

## 9. Complexity
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Provide a breakdown of the time and space complexity of critical algorithms.
- **Trade-offs**: Discuss any trade-offs between simplicity and performance, or between flexibility and maintainability.

---

## 10. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
- **Class Hierarchy**: Describe the class hierarchy and object relationships, including inheritance and composition.
- **Design Patterns**: List any design patterns used and the rationale for their inclusion.
- **SOLID Principles**: Explain how the design adheres to the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).

---

## 11. Database Normalization
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Include an ER diagram of the database schema.
- **Normalization**: Describe the level of normalization achieved (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.) and justify any denormalized structures.
- **Data Integrity**: Explain how data integrity is ensured through constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints).
